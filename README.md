By following a tutorial from the CodingNepal channel on YouTube, I created
a customizable AI chatbot built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, powered by the free Gemini API. It features real-time messaging, file upload support, an emoji picker, and chat historyâ€”all wrapped in a clean, responsive UI.

Features:

Natural language responses powered by the Gemini API

Typing animation for a more realistic experience

File upload support for added functionality

Integrated emoji picker for expressive messaging

Toggleable chatbot popup interface

Persistent chat history for session continuity
